As part of the DSSG program, the participants are blogging about their
experience. In these blogs, the participants have been sharing their thoughts
coming into the program, and their thoughts about some of the interesting
aspects of the programt that they have encountered along the way.

As we enter the second half of the program, we hope that more and more
results start appearing on these blogs documenting the progress of the projects:

The blogs can be found at:

- [Predicting permanent housing](http://uwescience.github.io/DSSG2015-predicting-permanent-housing/)

- [Mapping community well-being](http://uwescience.github.io/DSSG2015-wellbeing/)

- [Optimizing paratransit](http://dssg-paratransit.github.io/main_repo/)

- [Creating the accessible sidewalk graph](http://uwescience.github.io/DSSG_sidewalk/)
